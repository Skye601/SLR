### Chinese Sign Language Recognition Dataset  
1. [DEVISIGN](http://vipl.ict.ac.cn/homepage/ksl/data.html)  
  the DEVISIGN database covers 4414 standard Chinese Sign Language vocabularies and totally contains 331,050 vocabulary
  data of 30 individuals(13 males and 17 females). Each vocabulary data is 
  composed of RGB video(in “avi” format), the depth and skeleton information (in “bin” format). 
  This database contains both inter-sign and intra-sign changes. For 15 signers, the data were collected by 4 times 
  and for the remaining signers, the data were captured only one time.
